=========

R scripts for datamining.

This project aims to efficiently implement the CRISP datamining cycle.
Initially we focus on supervised models for dichotomous class predictive models.

The project tries to combine R scripts with knitr in R-studio in such a way that we walk through the CRISP phases and deliver a scoring model in the most efficient way.
In the meantime we would like to document our steps in a report that is nice enough to be used a reference of the work been done.

From wikipedia:
CRISP-DM breaks the process of data mining into six major phases:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modelling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

In this project we focus on automating the steps of Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modelling, Evaluation.
