Data Analysis Report
========================================================

This is the first attempt to transform the `Rmd` source for dataMineR into a pdf file. Some things are not yet as they should be: html tables are obviously not converted properly.

Other things work out of the box: syntax highlighting (although not yet accurate) and TOC generation.


Introduction
------------------------
This data analysis report is generated using R-studio and knitr to knit R code and markdown into html format. We have the option to include all R code that is used to generate the plots and calculations. Default this feauture is dissabled.
The data analysis step is the first step an a datamining analysis.

Dataset Basic Artifacts 
------------------------------------
Basic information from the dataset we are using.

### Basic dataset information

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# set global chunk options APPERENTLY CANNOT BE EXTERNALIZED
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, cache=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, error=TRUE)
library(pander)
# read externalized R from R script
read_chunk("data-analysis.R")
```


```{r read_data, echo=TRUE}

```
We are using data from file : `r path2file`
The dataset has `r colums` variables and `r rows` rows.  

The case identifyer is *`r original_case_id`* this is unique for all cases.

Variabele types
-----------------------------
```{r var_types}

```
The following variabeles are present in the dataset:
`r var_names` 

We have `r num_vars` numeric variables and `r cat_vars` categorical variables (or factors in R).


Excluded variables
------------------------------
From the varables provided the folowing list will be excluded in this anlysis: `r exclude_var_names`

Sometimes categoric variables are present as coded numbers. These should be treated as factors.
In this dataset the following variables will be used as factors(categoric): `r treat_as_categorical`

We have `r num_vars` numeric variables and `r cat_vars` categorical variables (or factors in R).

Numeric variables
=============================
Here we analyse all numeric variables. We start with an overview on basic statistics per variable. We check for missing values. We do a histogram plot to show the distribution for this variable. And we test for outliers.


Overview
-----------------------------
In the table below we report the number of observations (n), the smallest observation (min),  the first quantile (q1), the media ,  the mean, last quantile, the largest observation (max), and the nber of missing values (na).

```{r num-overview-md, results='asis'}

```

```{r run-numeric-md, include=FALSE}
out = NULL
for (i in c(1:num_vars)) {
  out = c(out, knit_child('da-numeric.Rmd'))
}
```

`r paste(out, collapse = '\n')`
